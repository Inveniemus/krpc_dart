kRPC Dart Library
=================

This library provides a [kRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/) client written in [Dart](https://dart.dev). Its purpose is to ease web and mobile apps 
connected to Kerbal Space Program, using Google's frameworks, such as [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), or a web application.
All classes, procedures, enumerations, etc. provided by the kRPC server are statically built by the... builder!
